# Project-3-Opening-Weekend

July 14
Looked into potential data sources.

From BOXOFFICEMOJO.COM:
Got list of 2,090 movies' opening weekend box office takes.
    * Weekend equals Fri-Sat-Sun. Movies that do not have a 3-day opening gross are not included on this chart.
    ^ Total Gross does not include additional releases, if any.
    ** First weekend of wide release.
Includes title, studio, opening weekend gross, number of theaters opening, date

I think I will be getting the remaining data from TMDB (THEMOVIEDB.ORG) 's API.
rating, director(s), writer(s), approx. budget, runtime, genres
Signed up for API key.

For director IDs, writer IDs, and genres, I will use the dummy function.
